## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Streamed answers on a reused keep-alive connection (every browser request after the CORS preflight) were closed by uvicorn's 5 s keep-alive timer mid-stream (`net::ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING`). Cause: Starlette `BaseHTTPMiddleware` layers in the stack (slowapi's alone reproduced it). `RequestIDMiddleware`, `ErrorEnvelopeMiddleware` and `MetricsMiddleware` are now pure ASGI and the slowapi middleware is replaced by a pure-ASGI per-IP limiter (`api/ratelimit.py`, same 100 req/min default, 429 envelope with `Retry-After`); `--timeout-keep-alive 65` added to the Render start command as belt and braces. Regression test runs a real uvicorn server (`tests/unit/test_keepalive_streaming.py`).
- SSE responses opt out of GZipMiddleware (`Content-Encoding: identity`): browsers send `Accept-Encoding: gzip` and Starlette's streaming gzip only flushes when zlib's buffer fills, so the "live" token stream arrived as one burst at the end of every answer.
- Groq retired `llama-3.1-8b-instant` / `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for free-tier use (2026-08-16, 404 `model_not_found`), which made every failover fail. Catalogue now carries `openai/gpt-oss-20b` / `openai/gpt-oss-120b` with Groq's list prices; the old ids are legacy aliases, and `FALLBACK_MODELS` resolves them.
- Provider snapshot ids (`gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`) are priced as their catalogue alias; the JSON path reported `cost_usd: null` before.
- Live demo outage: OpenAI `insufficient_quota` was retried as a rate limit and surfaced as "Request failed"; it is now a non-retryable 402 with a structured error envelope, and the request fails over to Groq (`docs/DIAGNOSIS.md`, ADR 0003).
- Unhandled 500s now carry CORS headers (error-envelope middleware inside CORS).
- Unreachable `REDIS_URL` no longer blocks startup for ~75 s; it falls back to an in-process cache within 2 s (ADR 0001).
- OpenAI streaming mixin crashed on the SDK's trailing usage chunk and let raw SDK errors escape the failover chain.
- 79 failing integration tests triaged: fixtures repaired, drift fixed, 19 tests for APIs that never existed deleted with git evidence (`docs/TEST_TRIAGE.md`).

### Added
- ADR 0006 (system evals as committed artifacts; UI shows observed numbers only); ADR 0005 consequences record the removed WebSocket client and the two streaming defects found in browsers. README rewritten around the guided demo, the Evidence rail and `/evals`, with a screenshot section (placeholder images) and no hand-typed numbers; demo script updated. Superseded banners on the three pre-SSE deployment documents; `docs/API.md` labels the WebSocket API full-deployment only and documents both rate-limit layers.
- `/evals` page: run metadata card with source badge (live API vs committed copy), cache precision/recall/F1 tiles, confusion matrix, by-kind table, SVG threshold sweep with the configured threshold marked and a full table behind a disclosure, five example pairs, failover and streaming-contract pass tiles with per-check counts, latency table by path, a plain-English explainer per section, and the per-worker `/metrics` caveat as a footnote. Renders from `frontend/lib/evals/latest.json` at build time so it works while the backend sleeps, then prefers the live artifact when the backend answers and it is at least as new.
- `evals/` package and `make evals`: cache paraphrase eval (68 labelled pairs: paraphrases, normalisation, different-intent near-duplicates, negation and entity-swap traps; precision/recall/F1, confusion matrix, threshold sweep with an F1-optimal pick), failover eval (10 simulated outages, per-check pass counts, added latency vs baseline), SSE contract eval (10 invariants over 20 mixed streams), latency eval (client and server P50/P95/P99 per path). Writes the schema-versioned `evals/results/latest.json` with run timestamp, commit SHA and request count, a Markdown summary, and a copy for the frontend build. Scoring functions are unit-tested on fixture data; `scripts/bench_demo.py` now shares `evals.stats.percentile`.
- `SEMANTIC_CACHE_THRESHOLD` default is now the F1-optimal 0.76 from that sweep (was 0.85 by hand); `cache.nearest_key` added to telemetry so a miss says which entry was closest.
- Groq `openai/gpt-oss-*` requests set `reasoning_effort=low`: at the demo's token cap the default effort spent the whole budget on reasoning and returned empty answers (caught by the failover eval).
- Frontend Evidence rail (`frontend/components/evidence/`): cache hit rate, spent vs avoided, client-observed P50/P95, TTFB on streamed misses, failover count, per-message latency sparkline, provider distribution, failover timeline with attempt chains; every tile has a keyboard-reachable "why this matters" tooltip. Derived by a pure, Vitest-covered `computeSessionStats`; missing Phase 1 fields are treated as unknown, never zero.
- Guided demo (three real requests: question, paraphrase, simulated outage) that explains each observed result, including why a paraphrase missed.
- Client-observed timings per message (`clientMs`, `clientTtfbMs`), "Conversation memory" toggle (off by default: each message is a standalone request so repeats and paraphrases can hit the cache), "New chat" that keeps the evidence, mobile Evidence drawer, header pills renamed to SSE Streaming / Semantic Cache / Multi-Provider Failover, `/evals` nav link, reduced-motion support.
- Semantic (paraphrase) cache on the demo path: exact key first, then OpenAI embeddings in a bounded in-process index scoped by tenant, model, temperature and prior conversation; degrades to exact-match with `cache.semantic = "unavailable"` (ADR 0007, supersedes the exact-match-only part of ADR 0001).
- Telemetry additions on `done` / JSON: `cost_avoided_usd`, `cache.match`, real `cache.similarity`, `cache.semantic`, `cache.matched_key`, `cache.threshold`, `cache.age_seconds`, `embedding {model, tokens, latency_ms, cost_usd}`; a hit now preserves the original `usage.source` instead of relabelling an estimate as provider-reported.
- `GET /api/v1/evals/latest` serving the committed eval artifact with ETag / 304 / 404 envelope.
- `/metrics` is real Prometheus exposition: `http_requests_total`, `http_request_duration_seconds`, `cache_hits_total`, `cache_misses_total`, `chat_cache_lookups_total{result}` (TEST_TRIAGE escalation 4 resolved). Per-worker, reset on deploy; documented in `docs/API.md`.
- Provider failover chain with per-request attempt log; Groq via the OpenAI-compatible endpoint (no new SDK).
- SSE streaming on `POST /api/v1/chat/completions` (ADR 0005) and a per-message telemetry chip in the UI.
- Demo guardrails: per-IP limits, token caps, daily budget (ADR 0004); env-gated "simulate provider failure" toggle.
- `scripts/bench_demo.py`, `docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md`, five ADRs, `docs/audits/`.
- `make help` with `install`, `dev`, `check`, `up`, `bench`, and friends.

### Changed
- Default model `gpt-4o-mini`; legacy ids (`gpt-3.5-turbo`) map forward.
- Vector search is off by default and never imports Pinecone unless `ENABLE_VECTOR_SEARCH=true` (ADR 0002).
- `render.yaml` targets the free tier: one worker, no Redis service.
- README metrics restricted to committed artifacts; measured coverage (31%) replaces the "85%+" claim.
- Repository layout: `config/`, `deploy/`, `demo/`, `examples/`, `use-cases/`, `nginx/`, `redis/`, `monitoring/` and 20+ legacy scripts removed or merged under `docker/` and `infrastructure/` (`docs/audits/REPO_AUDIT.md`).
- Poetry metadata moved to PEP 621 `[project]`; `mypy.ini` folded into `pyproject.toml`.
