# Production Deployment Checklist

> **Superseded (2026-09-08).** This document predates the demo's current design and describes a
> WebSocket-based frontend and manual deployment steps that no longer exist. The demo streams over
> Server-Sent Events (ADR 0005) and the frontend ships no WebSocket client. Current instructions:
> [`frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md`](../frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md), [`render.yaml`](../render.yaml) and the
> README's Quick start. Kept for the full-deployment history only.

## Pre-Deployment

### Backend (Render)
- [ ] Created render.yaml configuration
- [ ] Set OPENAI_API_KEY in Render dashboard
- [ ] Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in Render dashboard
- [ ] Created Redis instance on Render
- [ ] Updated CORS_ORIGINS with actual Vercel domain
- [ ] Verified health check endpoint works locally
- [ ] Tested WebSocket connection locally
- [ ] Reviewed security settings (rate limiting, CORS, etc.)
- [ ] Confirmed Python dependencies in pyproject.toml

### Frontend (Vercel)
- [ ] Created .env.production with backend URL
- [ ] Updated vercel.json with production config
- [ ] Tested API client configuration
- [ ] Verified WebSocket reconnection logic
- [ ] Reviewed security headers
- [ ] Tested build locally: `npm run build`
- [ ] Confirmed all environment variables are set

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend to Render

#### Step 1.1: Create Render Account
- [ ] Sign up at https://render.com
- [ ] Connect GitHub account to Render

#### Step 1.2: Create Redis Instance
1. From Render dashboard, click "New +"
2. Select "Redis"
3. Choose "Starter" plan ($7/month)
4. Name it "chatbot-redis"
5. Click "Create Redis"
6. Wait for deployment to complete
- [ ] Redis instance created and running

#### Step 1.3: Deploy Backend Service
1. From Render dashboard, click "New +"
2. Select "Web Service"
3. Connect your repository
4. Render will auto-detect render.yaml
5. Click "Create Web Service"
- [ ] Backend service created

#### Step 1.4: Configure Environment Variables
In Render dashboard, add these secret environment variables:
- [ ] OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key
- [ ] ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Your Anthropic API key

Note: All other variables are pre-configured in render.yaml

#### Step 1.5: Update CORS Configuration
After deploying frontend (step 2), update in Render dashboard:
- [ ] Update CORS_ORIGINS with actual Vercel domain
- [ ] Format: `["https://your-actual-domain.vercel.app","http://localhost:3000"]`

#### Step 1.6: Verify Backend Deployment
- [ ] Backend is deployed and running
- [ ] Check https://your-app.onrender.com/health
- [ ] Health check returns: `{"status": "healthy", ...}`
- [ ] Redis connection shows as "healthy" in health check
- [ ] API documentation accessible at https://your-app.onrender.com/docs

### 2. Deploy Frontend to Vercel

#### Step 2.1: Update Environment Variables
1. Edit frontend/.env.production
2. Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL to your Render backend URL
3. Set NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL to your Render WebSocket URL
- [ ] Environment variables updated with actual URLs
- [ ] Example: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://chatbot-ai-backend.onrender.com

#### Step 2.2: Deploy to Vercel
Option A: Vercel CLI
```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run build  # Test build locally
vercel --prod
```

Option B: Vercel Dashboard
1. Visit https://vercel.com
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your repository
4. Select "frontend" as root directory
5. Deploy
- [ ] Frontend deployed successfully

#### Step 2.3: Configure Vercel Environment Variables
In Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: Your Render backend URL
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL: Your Render WebSocket URL (wss://)
- [ ] Redeploy if environment variables were added after initial deployment

#### Step 2.4: Verify Frontend Deployment
- [ ] Visit your Vercel URL
- [ ] Application loads successfully
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools

### 3. Update Backend CORS
Now that frontend is deployed:
- [ ] Update CORS_ORIGINS in Render dashboard
- [ ] Include your actual Vercel domain
- [ ] Redeploy backend service

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Backend Health Checks
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200: https://your-app.onrender.com/health
- [ ] Redis connection works (check health response)
- [ ] API endpoint accessible: https://your-app.onrender.com/docs
- [ ] CORS headers allow Vercel domain
- [ ] Rate limiting works (test with >100 requests/min)

### Frontend Verification
- [ ] Application loads: https://your-app.vercel.app
- [ ] Can connect to backend API
- [ ] WebSocket connection establishes
- [ ] Can send chat messages
- [ ] Receives streaming responses
- [ ] Error handling works correctly

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end chat flow works
- [ ] Streaming responses display correctly
- [ ] WebSocket reconnects after disconnect
- [ ] API errors display user-friendly messages
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Cache system works (if enabled)

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] API response time < 2 seconds
- [ ] WebSocket connection time < 1 second
- [ ] No memory leaks in long sessions

## Monitoring Setup

### Render Monitoring
- [ ] Check Render logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor CPU and memory usage
- [ ] Monitor Redis memory usage
- [ ] Set up log retention policy

### Vercel Monitoring
